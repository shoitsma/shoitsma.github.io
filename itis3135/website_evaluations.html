            <h3><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/">Overwatch 2 Home Page</a></h3>
            <p>This site is designed to provide information about Overwatch 2.  The page includes a link to download the game, 
                updates about the game, and basic information targeted at new players.
            </p>
            <ul>CRAP Principles:
                <li>Contrast</li>
                <li>Repetition</li>
                <li>Alignment</li>
                <li>Proximity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is a good website.  There is no area on the page in which contrast
                is poor.  Repetition exists within each informational blurb
                (e.g., the image slideshow of all the maps). Alignment is also present
                (e.g., the news section has all news boxes aligned).  Proximity
                is generally well done but in the footer there is some extra space.

            <h3><a href="https://badhtml.com/">Bad HTML</a></h3>
            <p>This site is designed to be visually distracting.  There are multiple animations present
                and the background is a rainbow gradient.
            </p>
            <ul>CRAP Principles:
                <li>Contrast</li>
                <li>Repetition</li>
                <li>Alignment</li>
                <li>Proximity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is a bad website.  The contrast on this site is okay in some areas but poor
                in most.  The animations are distracting and make the text difficult to read.  Repetition
                is present within the boxes (e.g., the sidebar with the external links).  Alignment is poor
                because some of the borders on the boxes are not aligned with each other.  This page does not
                follow good proximity practices because in some areas the text is too close together and in others
                there is too much empty space.
